## General Information
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Conclusions
- The problems of overfitting and class imbalance were tackeled using data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator and Augmentor libraries
- Built a CNN model to clasify skin diseases with a validation accuracy of ~90%


## Technologies Used
- python 3
- jupyter notebook
